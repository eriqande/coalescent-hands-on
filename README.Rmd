This is a small Rstudio project with a few notebooks that provide
a way for students to learn about Kingman's neutral coalescent. 

They were originally written for a remote lecture I gave at University of
Montana for the Conservation Genomics class there.  These were modified
for a guest lecture I am giving in the graduate level Conservation Genetics
course at Colorado State University taught by Chris Funk and Kristen Ruegg.

I subsequently started using them at the ConGen Workshop.

The html versions of the notebooks are available directly from
a page with links to them at:
